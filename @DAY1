You have been given an array ‘a’ of ‘n’ unique non-negative integers.Find the second largest and second smallest element from the array.
Return the two elements (second largest and second smallest) as another array of size 2.
Example :
Input: ‘n’ = 5, ‘a’ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [4, 2]
The second largest element after 5 is 4, and the second smallest element after 1 is 2.

import java.util.Arrays;
class Solution
{
        public static int[] get_second(int n, int[]a)
        {
                Arrays.sort(a);
                return new int[]{a[n-2],a[1]};
        }
}
